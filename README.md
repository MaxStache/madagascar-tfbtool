## Requirements

- Python >= 3.12 (uses `typing.override`, added in 3.12)
- Dependencies from `requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

### CLI

```sh
python -m tfbscript example_scripts/Teleporter.ai
python -m tfbscript --no-color example_scripts/*.ai
```

Syntax coloring is auto-detected: on for a real terminal, off when piped or
when `NO_COLOR` is set. Force it with `--color` / `--no-color`.

### As a library

```python
from tfbscript import ScriptFile

script = ScriptFile.from_path("example_scripts/Teleporter.ai")
script.print_tree()
```

### Needs attention / TODOs

- `cut-scene::op-code` - confirm assumptions on value

- `spawn actor::op-code` - find out purpose of remaining byte

- `use camera::op-code` - implement

- enums.py, CutsceneCommand - Figure out what 0 is

- `comment:::op-code` - the ops name is actually comment: but we split it wrong to `comment`, `:op-code` instead the expected result should be `comment:`, `op-code`

- `displace::op-code` - confirm fields
